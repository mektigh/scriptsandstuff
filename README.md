# Josh's PowerShell collection

A collection of PowerShell scripts, tooling, and some of my modules.

Mostly related to some of my projects, my work, or just a post in my [blog](http://hochwald.net).

Most of the stuff here is also available as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/jhochwald) or on my personal [blog](http://hochwald.net).

[![Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=jhochwald&repo=PowerShell-collection&theme=transparent)](https://github.com/jhochwald/PowerShell-collection)

## Please note

Some, or better most, of the stuff here was a function.

This is because I like functions more (my personal preference). I converted some to single files.

You can convert them back if you like.

### Why so detailed?

I was asked why all my scripts contain so many comments, and why they are so well formatted... I hope you do not just download them and let them run (What is dangerous anyway).

They should show you how to build and create your own tooling!

That is the main reason why I try to avoid the usage of aliases within my scripts and use splatting to make them more human readable.

### Why in general?

Many ask me that question!
The answer is simple: "_I like to contribute back to the community!_"

The long answer: "_I still try to automate all the things! And I love to show what PowerShell can do... As a result, I started to publish a lot of code. Things I build, things I like, or just things I found interesting to build :-)_"

## Found a bug or Issue?

If you find something bad (like a bug, error, or any issue), please report it here by open an [Issue](https://github.com/jhochwald/PowerShell-collection/issues).

Or even better: Fork the Repository, fix it and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/jhochwald/PowerShell-collection/pulls), so others can participate too!

See the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details!

### Any idea: Looking for a code signing certificate

I still search for a free code signing certificate for my open-source projects. So, does anyone know a source?

Even if there is no "_free_" version for my open-source projects, I would also pay for a valid certificate (again).

However, most of the sources I found are not cheap!

Does anyone know a cheap source for a signing certificate?

## Default License

In my opinion: All the stuff here should be free, and the license should be as flexible as possible.
